# Folder Structure
In topmost, questions are organised into modules. Each module contains multiple chapters and each chapter can have multiple questions.


It is important that the files are structured properly so that it is easy to create and manage. We recommend following structure.

 * modules.csv
 * module 1
    * chapters.csv
    * chapter1.csv
    * chapter2.csv
* module 2
    * chapters.csv
    * chapter1.csv
    * chapter2.csv
